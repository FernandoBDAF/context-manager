## 🎓 Key Learnings Captured

1. **Infrastructure Validation Requires Hybrid Approach**
   - Combine AI preparation (scripts, docs) with human execution
   - Most effective for complex infrastructure

2. **Real Data Validation Essential**
   - Configuration issues only appear with production-like data
   - Cannot validate with toy datasets

3. **Metrics Design Affects Operations**
   - Poor design impacts system scalability
   - Cardinality explosion must be planned for

4. **Query Scripts Reveal Deep Insights**
   - Superior to logs for understanding complex systems
   - Highly effective for debugging

5. **Transformation Logging Powerful**
   - Critical for understanding system behavior
   - Fine-grained logging pays off

6. **Configuration Validation Often Overlooked**
   - Responsible for ~30% of issues
   - Need systematic validation layer

7. **Documentation Timing Critical**
   - Document findings in real-time
   - Accuracy and value improve when captured immediately

8. **Performance Testing Reveals Scaling Issues**
   - Only appears with realistic data volumes
   - Cannot predict without actual testing
