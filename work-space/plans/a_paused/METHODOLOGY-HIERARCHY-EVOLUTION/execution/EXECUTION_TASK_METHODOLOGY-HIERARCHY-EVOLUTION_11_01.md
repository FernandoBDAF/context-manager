# EXECUTION_TASK: SUBPLAN Independent Workflow Documentation - Execution 01

**Parent SUBPLAN**: SUBPLAN_METHODOLOGY-HIERARCHY-EVOLUTION_11.md  
**Achievement**: 1.1  
**Created**: 2025-11-08 12:40 UTC  
**Estimated**: 3-4 hours  
**Status**: 🎯 Executing

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create comprehensive guide documenting the new SUBPLAN independent workflow with 4 phases, decision trees, examples, and workflow diagrams.

---

## 🎨 Approach

Following SUBPLAN phases:
1. Create guide structure (overview, 4 phases)
2. Develop content (detailed steps, decision trees, examples)
3. Add integration points and diagrams

## 📝 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Guide Creation (Start: 12:40, End: 13:30)

**Goal**: Create comprehensive `LLM/guides/SUBPLAN-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md`

**Actions**:
- Created comprehensive guide (682 lines)
- Documented 4-phase workflow in detail:
  - Phase 1: Design (Designer Agent) - Create SUBPLAN, analyze, design approach
  - Phase 2: Execution Planning (Designer) - Plan multiple EXECUTIONs, decide parallel/sequential
  - Phase 3: Execution (Executor Agent) - Execute EXECUTION_TASK(s) independently
  - Phase 4: Synthesis (Designer) - Review results, synthesize learnings, complete SUBPLAN
- Added decision trees (single vs. multiple, parallel vs. sequential)
- Added workflow diagrams (ASCII art visualization)
- Added 3 comprehensive examples:
  - A/B testing (parallel multiple EXECUTIONs)
  - Iterative refinement (sequential multiple EXECUTIONs)
  - Single EXECUTION (simple work)
- Added integration points (templates, protocols, automation)
- Added best practices for Designers and Executors
- Added FAQ section

**Result**: ✅ Guide created successfully (682 lines, comprehensive)

## 📊 Learning Summary

### What Worked Well

- Comprehensive guide covers all 4 phases in detail
- Decision trees provide clear guidance
- Examples illuminate different patterns
- Workflow diagrams visualize process
- Best practices actionable

### Key Insights

1. **4-phase workflow enables true separation** - Designer and Executor roles clearly defined
2. **Multi-EXECUTION planning is powerful** - A/B testing, iterative refinement, parallel work
3. **Decision trees critical** - When to use single vs. multiple, parallel vs. sequential
4. **Examples essential** - Real scenarios help understanding

### Statistics

**Time Taken**: 50 minutes vs. 3-4h estimated (79% under estimate)
- Guide creation: 50 minutes (comprehensive single pass)

**Actual vs. Estimated**: 0.8h vs. 3.5h (77% under estimate)
- Work was efficient (comprehensive guide in single pass)
- Clear requirements made execution straightforward

**Lines Created**:
- SUBPLAN-WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md: 682 lines (comprehensive)
- **Total**: 682 lines of new documentation

**Quality**: High
- Comprehensive coverage of all phases
- Clear decision trees
- Helpful examples
- Visual diagrams
- Actionable best practices
