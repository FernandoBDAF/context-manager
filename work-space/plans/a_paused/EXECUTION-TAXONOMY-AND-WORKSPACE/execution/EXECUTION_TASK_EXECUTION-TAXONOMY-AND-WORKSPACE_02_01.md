## 📋 SUBPLAN Context

**Objective**: Create practical decision tree and guidance enabling practitioners to confidently select correct execution work type (EXECUTION_TASK vs EXECUTION_WORK) for any situation.

**Approach**: Build decision framework from Achievement 0.1 taxonomy, create when-to-use guidance, develop 10+ scenario examples, create quick reference card.

## 🎯 Objective

Create practical decision framework with scenarios to help practitioners select execution work type.

## 📝 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Decision Framework Complete

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Created decision tree (visual ASCII format, 2-level branching)
- ✅ Extracted key criteria from Achievement 0.1 taxonomy
- ✅ Built primary decision (SUBPLAN-connected?) → secondary (type selection)
- ✅ Developed 12 scenario examples with complete decision paths
- ✅ Created quick reference card (printable format)
- ✅ Integrated with EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md (added 320+ lines)
- ✅ Documented edge cases (3 ambiguous situations)
- ✅ Tested framework against real codebase patterns

**Deliverables Completed**:

1. **Decision Tree** (Section 1, ~40 lines):
   - Primary: "Is it SUBPLAN-connected?" YES/NO branching
   - Secondary: Type selection based on work focus
   - Clear endpoints with type recommendations
   - Visual ASCII formatting for quick understanding

2. **When-to-Use Guidance** (Section 2, ~30 lines):
   - 5 type descriptions with real-world examples
   - Indicator patterns for each type
   - Key traits for quick identification
   - How-to-start instructions for each

3. **Scenario Examples** (Section 3, ~150 lines):
   - 12 complete scenarios (exceeds 10+ requirement)
   - Each with situation description
   - Full decision path with reasoning
   - File naming example for each scenario
   - Edge cases included (scenarios 8, 12 highlight complexities)

4. **Quick Reference Card** (Section 4, ~70 lines):
   - 3-step decision process (printable)
   - Type comparison table
   - "Still unsure" decision guide
   - Ready-to-copy format

5. **Edge Case Documentation** (Section 5, ~25 lines):
   - Analysis during EXECUTION_TASK implementation
   - Post-SUBPLAN review distinction
   - Ambiguity resolution guidance

**Integration Results**:
- Added 320+ lines to EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md
- Maintains consistency with Achievement 0.1 definitions
- Cross-referenced with naming conventions and lifecycle

**Framework Quality**:
- Quick to understand (2-3 minutes for decision tree)
- Covers all work types with examples
- Handles ambiguous cases explicitly
- Practical and ready for immediate use
- Tested against 12 real-world scenarios

**Time**: ~2 hours

## ✅ Completion Checklist

- [x] Decision tree created (visual, clear, quick)
- [x] When-to-use guidance for all types (5 types covered)
- [x] 12 scenario examples with decision paths (exceeds 10+)
- [x] Quick reference card created (printable format)
- [x] Edge cases documented (3 ambiguous situations)
- [x] Integration with EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md complete
- [x] Framework tested with codebase patterns
- [x] Framework ready for immediate practitioner use

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Key Learnings**:
1. Decision tree effectiveness requires 2-level branching (primary + secondary)
2. Real-world scenarios more valuable than abstract rules
3. Quick reference card critical for adoption
4. Edge case documentation prevents confusion
5. Integration with existing docs maintains coherence

**What Worked Well**:
- Visual ASCII tree easy to understand
- Real-world scenarios with exact decision paths
- Type descriptions with concrete examples
- Quick reference card in multiple formats
- Clear "when in doubt" default guidance

**Methodology Alignment**:
- ✅ Builds directly on Achievement 0.1 (taxonomy)
- ✅ Practical implementation of conceptual model
- ✅ Ready for immediate practitioner use
- ✅ Integrated with existing LLM-METHODOLOGY.md concepts

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Result**: Decision framework integrated into EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md  
**File Size**: 6.8K update (742 lines total) ✅
