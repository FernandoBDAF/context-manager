## 📖 SUBPLAN Context

**Parent SUBPLAN**: `work-space/plans/EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE/subplans/SUBPLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_22.md`

**SUBPLAN Objective** (read only):
- Update parent GrammaPlan with stable execution work taxonomy established in Achievements 0.1-0.3, enabling coordination with other child PLANs and locking taxonomy as stable

**SUBPLAN Approach Summary** (read only):
- Document stable taxonomy in GrammaPlan Cross-Cutting Concerns section
- Update child PLAN descriptions to reflect taxonomy completion
- Add coordination notes and mark taxonomy as STABLE
- Establish protocol for future taxonomy modifications

---

## 📋 What We're Building

Updating parent GrammaPlan to document the stable execution work taxonomy, enabling other child PLANs to reference it with confidence and establishing coordination protocol for future changes.

**Success**: GrammaPlan updated, taxonomy marked stable, coordination protocol established

## 🔄 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: GrammaPlan Update & Taxonomy Documentation

**Date**: 2025-11-09 17:00 UTC  
**Work**: Updated GRAMMAPLAN_EXECUTION-WORK-SYSTEM-ENHANCEMENT.md with stable taxonomy

**Deliverables Created**:

1. **Updated GRAMMAPLAN_EXECUTION-WORK-SYSTEM-ENHANCEMENT.md**
   - Cross-Cutting Concerns section updated (lines 494-509)
   - Taxonomy marked as STABLE with coordination requirement
   - All 6 types documented (EXECUTION_TASK + 5 EXECUTION_WORK types)
   - Reference to EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md for full details
   - Coordination protocol established

2. **Updated PLAN 1 Description** (lines 102-162)
   - Status updated to reflect completion (87.5% - 6/7 achievements)
   - Taxonomy marked as stable
   - Workspace structure documented
   - Decision tree and quick reference noted

3. **Coordination Notes Added**
   - Taxonomy is STABLE (changes require GrammaPlan coordination)
   - Other child PLANs can now reference stable taxonomy
   - Future modifications require GrammaPlan-level approval

**Key Updates**:
- Cross-Cutting Concerns: Taxonomy section marked STABLE
- PLAN 1 status: Updated to show taxonomy work complete
- Coordination: Protocol established for future changes
- Lock notification: Clear that taxonomy is stable

**Validation**:
- ✅ Taxonomy fully documented in GrammaPlan
- ✅ All 6 types listed (TASK + 5 WORK types)
- ✅ Reference to EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md included
- ✅ Coordination protocol clear
- ✅ Taxonomy marked as STABLE

---

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Coordination Insights**:
- Cross-Cutting Concerns section is perfect location for shared taxonomy
- Marking as STABLE prevents drift across child PLANs
- Clear coordination protocol enables future modifications when needed

**Integration Success**:
- Parent GrammaPlan now has stable taxonomy reference
- Child PLANs (2-5) can proceed with confidence
- Taxonomy lock prevents conflicting decisions

**Process Learnings**:
- GrammaPlan updates are straightforward coordination work
- Cross-Cutting Concerns section well-designed for shared foundations
- Stable taxonomy enables parallel work on other child PLANs
