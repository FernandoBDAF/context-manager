## 📖 SUBPLAN Context

**Parent SUBPLAN**: `work-space/plans/EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE/subplans/SUBPLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_23.md`

**SUBPLAN Objective** (read only):

- Verify and consolidate the archive & summarization system design from existing analysis documents, ensuring all required deliverables (strategic vision, technical architecture, integration roadmap, implementation checklist, success criteria) are present and complete, ready for implementation.

**SUBPLAN Approach Summary** (read only):

- Phase 1: Verify all three analysis documents exist and contain expected content. Phase 2: Identify any missing components (checklist, success criteria). Phase 3: Create missing components if needed. Phase 4: Create consolidation summary documenting readiness.
