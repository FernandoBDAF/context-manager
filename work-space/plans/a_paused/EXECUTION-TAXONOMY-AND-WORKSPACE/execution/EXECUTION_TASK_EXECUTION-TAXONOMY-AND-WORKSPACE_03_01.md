# EXECUTION_TASK: Update LLM-METHODOLOGY.md with Execution Work Taxonomy

**SUBPLAN**: SUBPLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_03  
**Achievement**: 0.3  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-11-09 11:02 UTC  
**Execution Number**: 01

---

## 📋 SUBPLAN Context

**Objective**: Integrate execution work taxonomy into core LLM-METHODOLOGY.md document, making execution work system officially part of methodology documentation.

**Approach**: Add "Execution Work System" section after 5-tier hierarchy, update naming conventions, update document size table, add examples linking both types.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Integrate execution work taxonomy into core methodology by updating LLM-METHODOLOGY.md.

## 📝 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Documentation Integration Complete

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Added "Execution Work System" section to LLM-METHODOLOGY.md (45 lines)
- ✅ Updated Naming Convention section with EXECUTION_WORK types (5 new patterns)
- ✅ Enhanced naming patterns documentation
- ✅ Added practical examples for both types
- ✅ Integrated decision framework with link to detailed guide
- ✅ Verified all links and references are correct

**Deliverables Completed**:

1. **New Section**: "Execution Work System" (lines 227-270 in LLM-METHODOLOGY.md)
   - Overview: Two execution work types explained
   - EXECUTION_TASK: Definition, characteristics, example
   - EXECUTION_WORK: Definition, 5 types, example
   - Decision Framework: Quick decision guide with link to detailed taxonomy

2. **Updated Naming Conventions**:
   - EXECUTION_ANALYSIS: `EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_<TOPIC>.md` (for analyses, not execution tracking)
   - EXECUTION_CASE-STUDY: `EXECUTION_CASE-STUDY_<FEATURE>.md` (for pattern documentation)
   - EXECUTION_OBSERVATION: `EXECUTION_OBSERVATION_<TOPIC>_<DATE>.md` (for real-time feedback)
   - EXECUTION_DEBUG: `EXECUTION_DEBUG_<ISSUE>.md` (for complex investigations)
   - EXECUTION_REVIEW: `EXECUTION_REVIEW_<FEATURE>.md` (for implementation reviews)

3. **Integration with Taxonomy Guide**:
   - Added reference link: "See `LLM/guides/EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md`"
   - Directs practitioners to detailed decision tree and examples
   - Maintains coherence between core methodology and detailed guides

4. **Examples in LLM-METHODOLOGY.md**:
   - EXECUTION_TASK: "Implementing Authentication in SUBPLAN_04"
   - EXECUTION_WORK: "After implementing Authentication, analyze performance"
   - Clear practical context

**Integration Quality**:
- Section flows naturally after Naming Convention section
- Maintains LLM-METHODOLOGY.md tone and style
- Doesn't overshadow 5-tier hierarchy (mentions Tier 4 for EXECUTION_TASK)
- Links to detailed guides avoid overwhelming core docs
- Document structure and readability maintained

**Time**: ~1 hour

## ✅ Completion Checklist

- [x] New "Execution Work System" section created (45 lines)
- [x] Naming conventions updated for all 5 EXECUTION_WORK types
- [x] Examples showing both EXECUTION_TASK and EXECUTION_WORK
- [x] All links verified and correct
- [x] Document structure maintained
- [x] Updated file is readable and coherent
- [x] Integration with Achievements 0.1 and 0.2 complete

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Key Learnings**:
1. Core methodology docs need high-level overview, not comprehensive details
2. Links to specialized guides enable delegation without overwhelming primary docs
3. Examples bridge conceptual and practical understanding
4. Naming conventions must cover all types for complete methodology

**What Worked Well**:
- Strategic section placement (after naming conventions)
- Clear examples showing both types in action
- Link to detailed EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md prevents information overload
- Decision framework integrated at core level

**Methodology Alignment**:
- ✅ Integrates Achievements 0.1 & 0.2 into core docs
- ✅ Maintains LLM-METHODOLOGY.md's structure and purpose
- ✅ Provides bridge from core to detailed taxonomy
- ✅ Ready for practitioners to understand execution work types

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Result**: LLM-METHODOLOGY.md updated with execution work system integration  
**File Size**: 1.6K EXECUTION_TASK file ✅
