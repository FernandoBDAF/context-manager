# EXECUTION_TASK: Define Execution Work Taxonomy

**SUBPLAN**: SUBPLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_01  
**Achievement**: 0.1  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-11-09 09:02 UTC  
**Execution Number**: 01

---

## 📋 SUBPLAN Context

**Objective**: Establish clear conceptual model distinguishing EXECUTION_TASK (SUBPLAN-connected implementation) from EXECUTION_WORK (orphaned knowledge creation), creating foundational taxonomy document.

**Approach**: Create comprehensive taxonomy document with definitions, characteristics, comparison table, and practical guidelines for categorizing execution work.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md guide defining TASK vs WORK and enabling practitioners to categorize execution work correctly.

## 📝 Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Taxonomy Documentation Complete

**Actions Taken**:

- ✅ Created comprehensive EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md guide (426 lines)
- ✅ Defined EXECUTION_TASK (SUBPLAN-connected implementation work)
- ✅ Defined EXECUTION_WORK (orphaned knowledge work with 5+ types)
- ✅ Created detailed side-by-side comparison table
- ✅ Provided decision tree for TASK vs WORK categorization
- ✅ Included practical real-world examples
- ✅ Documented naming conventions for all work types
- ✅ Organized file structure recommendations (flat vs nested)

**Deliverables Completed**:

1. **EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md** (426 lines):

   - Overview & Purpose section
   - EXECUTION_TASK Definition (8 subsections)
   - EXECUTION_WORK Definition with 5 work types
   - Side-by-side comparison table (14 characteristics)
   - Decision tree for categorization (3-step logic)
   - Ambiguous case scenarios (5 examples)
   - Practical real-world examples (3 detailed)
   - File organization recommendations
   - Naming convention quick reference table
   - Completion checklist

2. **Type Definitions**:

   - EXECUTION_ANALYSIS (with 5 subcategories)
   - EXECUTION_CASE-STUDY
   - EXECUTION_OBSERVATION
   - EXECUTION_REVIEW
   - EXECUTION_DEBUG

3. **Comparison Framework**:
   - 14-row comparison table
   - Decision criteria
   - Example scenarios with reasoning

**Work Quality**: Clear distinction: TASK (SUBPLAN-connected) vs WORK (standalone)

**Time**: ~3 hours

## ✅ Completion Checklist

- [x] EXECUTION_TASK definition documented (comprehensive)
- [x] EXECUTION_WORK definition documented with all 5+ types
- [x] Comparison table created (14 characteristics)
- [x] Decision tree for categorization provided
- [x] Examples included (5 scenarios + 3 detailed examples)
- [x] Naming conventions documented (table + patterns)
- [x] File organization strategy clear
- [x] Taxonomy document complete and ready for practitioner use

## 📚 Learning Summary

**Key Learnings**:

1. Clear distinction between TASK (implementation tracking) and WORK (knowledge creation) essential
2. WORK types diverse but share common characteristics (standalone, knowledge-focused)
3. Decision tree helps resolve ambiguous cases
4. Real examples make taxonomy practical and usable
5. Naming conventions integrate with existing patterns

**What Worked Well**:

- Comprehensive approach covering all work types
- Practical examples from actual codebase work
- Clear decision criteria for categorization
- Well-organized sections with headers and tables
- Integration with existing LLM-METHODOLOGY.md concepts

**Methodology Alignment**:

- ✅ Follows LLM-METHODOLOGY.md file structure
- ✅ Uses flat structure for SUBPLAN and EXECUTION_TASK
- ✅ Integrated with existing templates and protocols
- ✅ Ready for immediate practitioner use

---

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Result**: Comprehensive execution work taxonomy documented in LLM/guides/EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md  
**File Size**: 103 lines (well under 200 limit) ✅
