# SUBPLAN: Create Decision Tree for Type Selection

**Type**: SUBPLAN  
**Mother Plan**: PLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE.md  
**Plan**: EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE  
**Achievement Addressed**: Achievement 0.2 (Create Decision Tree for Type Selection)  
**Achievement**: 0.2  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-11-09 10:00 UTC  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

## 🎯 Objective

Create a practical decision tree and guidance system that enables practitioners to confidently select the correct execution work type (EXECUTION_TASK vs EXECUTION_WORK) for any given situation.

---

## 📋 What Needs to Be Created

### Files to Create/Modify

- Decision tree document (markdown format, 300-400 lines)
- Quick reference card (printable/copyable format)
- Integration with EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md guide

### Content Deliverables

1. **Decision Tree**:
   - Visual tree structure (ASCII or formatted)
   - Clear yes/no branch points
   - Type recommendations at each endpoint
   - Guidance for each decision

2. **When-to-Use Guidance**:
   - EXECUTION_TASK: conditions and examples
   - EXECUTION_ANALYSIS: conditions and examples
   - EXECUTION_CASE-STUDY: conditions and examples
   - EXECUTION_OBSERVATION: conditions and examples
   - EXECUTION_DEBUG: conditions and examples

3. **Scenario Examples**:
   - 10+ real-world scenarios
   - Each with decision path
   - Correct type selection explained
   - Reasoning for choice

4. **Quick Reference Card**:
   - One-page summary format
   - Decision criteria table
   - Type selection guide
   - Common scenarios table

---

## 📝 Approach

**Strategy**: Build practical decision framework that practitioners can use immediately without reading full taxonomy.

**Method**:

1. **Analyze Achievement 0.1 Results**
   - Review EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md definitions
   - Identify key decision criteria
   - Extract distinguishing characteristics

2. **Design Decision Tree**
   - Start with primary question (SUBPLAN-connected?)
   - Branch into secondary criteria (size, purpose)
   - Lead to clear type recommendation

3. **Create When-to-Use Guidance**
   - 2-3 sentences per type
   - Real conditions where used
   - Quick example of each

4. **Develop Scenario Examples**
   - 10+ real-world situations
   - Walk through decision tree for each
   - Explain why that type chosen
   - Include edge cases

5. **Build Quick Reference Card**
   - Single-page format
   - Decision table
   - Type comparison
   - Printable/copyable

6. **Integrate with Existing Guide**
   - Add decision tree to EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md
   - Cross-reference new documents
   - Maintain consistency

**Key Considerations**:

- Decision tree must be quick to understand (2-3 minutes max)
- Examples must be realistic and relatable
- Edge cases acknowledged and handled
- Integration with Achievement 0.1 taxonomy

---

## 🔄 Execution Strategy

**Execution Count**: Single

**Rationale**: 
- Single clear approach to decision framework
- Direct implementation from 0.1 taxonomy
- No iteration needed (straightforward guidance)
- All deliverables produced in one execution

**EXECUTION_TASK**: `EXECUTION_TASK_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_02_01.md`

---

## 🧪 Tests Required

**Type**: Framework validation (no code tests)

### Validation Approach

1. **Clarity Test**: Can practitioners use tree without full context?
2. **Completeness Test**: Do examples cover all type categories?
3. **Edge Case Test**: Are ambiguous situations handled?
4. **Consistency Test**: Does it align with Achievement 0.1 definitions?

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Decision tree clear and quick to understand
- [ ] When-to-use guidance practical and specific
- [ ] 10+ scenario examples provided with explanations
- [ ] Quick reference card created and copyable
- [ ] Integration with EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md complete
- [ ] No contradictions with Achievement 0.1
- [ ] Framework tested with edge cases

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### Observable Outcomes

- Decision tree document created
- Practitioners can select type confidently
- Quick reference card available
- Integration with existing taxonomy seamless

### Success Indicators

- [ ] Decision tree created and clear
- [ ] Guidance for each type provided
- [ ] 10+ scenarios with decision paths
- [ ] Quick reference card completed
- [ ] Framework ready for immediate use
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 🔍 Conflict Analysis with Other Subplans

**Review Existing Subplans**:

- SUBPLAN_01: Taxonomy definition (foundational - already complete)

**Check for**:

- **Overlap**: No - builds on taxonomy, doesn't duplicate
- **Conflicts**: No - extends SUBPLAN_01 with practical guidance
- **Dependencies**: Yes - requires SUBPLAN_01 complete (✅ done)
- **Integration**: Perfect - SUBPLAN_02 is practical layer on SUBPLAN_01

**Result**: Safe to proceed - complements prior work

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Other Subplans

- SUBPLAN_01 (EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md) - must be complete ✅

### External Dependencies

- Access to EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md file
- Understanding of execution work types
- Real examples from codebase

### Prerequisite Knowledge

- EXECUTION_TASK definition (from 0.1)
- EXECUTION_WORK definition (from 0.1)
- Comparison criteria (from 0.1)

## 🔄 Execution Task Reference

**Execution Tasks** (created during execution):

_None yet - will be created when execution starts_

**First Execution**: `EXECUTION_TASK_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_02_01.md`

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

**This Subplan is Complete When**:

- [ ] Decision tree document created
- [ ] When-to-use guidance provided for all types
- [ ] 10+ scenario examples with decision paths
- [ ] Quick reference card created
- [ ] Integration with EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md complete
- [ ] Framework tested with edge cases
- [ ] EXECUTION_TASK complete
- [ ] Ready for archive

---

## 📝 Notes

**Common Pitfalls**:

- Decision tree too complex - must be quick to understand
- Examples not realistic - use actual codebase patterns
- Missing edge cases - acknowledge ambiguous situations
- Not integrated - must connect to Achievement 0.1

**Resources**:

- EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md (from Achievement 0.1)
- Prior execution work examples in codebase
- EXECUTION_TASK and EXECUTION_ANALYSIS files as examples
