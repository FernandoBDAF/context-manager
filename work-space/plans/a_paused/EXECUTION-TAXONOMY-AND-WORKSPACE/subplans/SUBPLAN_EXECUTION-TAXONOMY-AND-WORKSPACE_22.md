# SUBPLAN: Update Parent GrammaPlan with Stable Taxonomy

**Type**: SUBPLAN  
**Mother Plan**: PLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE.md  
**Plan**: EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE  
**Achievement Addressed**: Achievement 2.2 (Update Parent GrammaPlan with Stable Taxonomy)  
**Achievement**: 2.2  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-11-09 17:00 UTC  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

---

## 🎯 Objective

Update the parent GrammaPlan (GRAMMAPLAN_EXECUTION-WORK-SYSTEM-ENHANCEMENT.md) with the stable execution work taxonomy established in Achievements 0.1-0.3, enabling coordination with other child PLANs and locking the taxonomy as stable (future changes require GrammaPlan-level coordination).

---

## 📋 What Needs to Be Created

### Primary Deliverable

**Updated GRAMMAPLAN_EXECUTION-WORK-SYSTEM-ENHANCEMENT.md**

**Sections to Update**:
1. **Cross-Cutting Concerns Section**
   - Document final taxonomy (EXECUTION_TASK vs EXECUTION_WORK)
   - List all 5 EXECUTION_WORK types
   - Reference EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md for details
   - Mark taxonomy as STABLE (changes require coordination)

2. **Child PLAN Descriptions**
   - Update PLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE description
   - Reflect actual taxonomy decisions made
   - Note completion status

3. **Coordination Notes**
   - Document any taxonomy changes affecting other child PLANs
   - Note which PLANs depend on stable taxonomy
   - Provide guidance for future taxonomy modifications

### Secondary Deliverables

- Coordination notes documenting taxonomy stability
- Taxonomy lock notification (mark as stable in GrammaPlan)

---

## 📝 Approach

**Strategy**: Document stable taxonomy in parent GrammaPlan's Cross-Cutting Concerns section, update child PLAN references, and establish coordination protocol for future changes

**Method**:

1. **Phase 1: Review GrammaPlan Structure**
   - Read GRAMMAPLAN_EXECUTION-WORK-SYSTEM-ENHANCEMENT.md
   - Locate "Cross-Cutting Concerns" section
   - Identify child PLAN descriptions section
   - Understand coordination structure

2. **Phase 2: Document Stable Taxonomy**
   - Add taxonomy summary to Cross-Cutting Concerns
   - Reference EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md for full details
   - List all 6 types (TASK + 5 WORK types)
   - Mark as STABLE with coordination requirement

3. **Phase 3: Update Child PLAN References**
   - Update PLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE description
   - Reflect completion of taxonomy work
   - Note stable taxonomy available for other PLANs

4. **Phase 4: Coordination Protocol**
   - Document that taxonomy is locked
   - Note that changes require GrammaPlan coordination
   - Provide guidance for future modifications

**Key Considerations**:
- Taxonomy is stable (no changes expected)
- Other child PLANs can now reference stable taxonomy
- Future changes require GrammaPlan-level coordination
- Cross-Cutting Concerns section is appropriate location

---

## 🔄 Execution Strategy

**Execution Count**: Single

**Rationale**:
- Straightforward coordination work
- Single clear approach (document in GrammaPlan)
- All deliverables created together
- No dependencies on execution order

**EXECUTION_TASK**: `EXECUTION_TASK_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_22_01.md`

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Deliverables** (to be created by EXECUTION_TASK):

1. ✅ Updated GRAMMAPLAN_EXECUTION-WORK-SYSTEM-ENHANCEMENT.md
   - Cross-Cutting Concerns section with stable taxonomy
   - Child PLAN descriptions updated
   - Coordination notes added

2. ✅ Taxonomy marked as STABLE
   - Future changes require GrammaPlan coordination
   - Clear protocol for modifications

3. ✅ Coordination notes
   - Impact on other child PLANs documented
   - Guidance for future taxonomy work

**Success Criteria**:
- Parent GrammaPlan has stable taxonomy documented
- Child PLANs can reference stable taxonomy
- Coordination protocol established
- Taxonomy lock notification clear

**Ready For**: Other child PLANs to reference stable taxonomy with confidence

---

## 🧪 Tests Required

N/A - Coordination work (no code testing)

**Validation Instead**:
- Completeness: Taxonomy fully documented in GrammaPlan
- Accuracy: Taxonomy matches EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md
- Clarity: Coordination protocol clear
- Stability: Lock notification present
