## 🎯 Goal

Make all files in `work-space/analyses/` compliant with EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md naming conventions.

## 📊 Current State

**Files in Scope**: 54 analysis files across 9 thematic subfolders

**Preliminary Assessment**:
- ✅ 50 EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_* files (appear compliant)
- ✅ 4 EXECUTION_DEBUG_* files (appear compliant)
- ✅ 9 INDEX.md files (excluded from renaming)
- ✅ Organized in thematic subfolders

**Initial Compliance**: ~100% (to be formally verified)

## 🎯 Achievements

### Priority 0: CRITICAL - Compliance Audit and Verification

**Achievement 0.1**: Comprehensive Compliance Audit (1-1.5h)
- Audit all 54 files for EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md compliance
- Verify naming patterns (EXECUTION_ANALYSIS_*, EXECUTION_DEBUG_*)
- Sample content verification (5-10 files)
- Create compliance report with recommendations

**Achievement 0.2**: Rename Operations Executed (0.5-1.5h)
- Execute any necessary renames (if needed)
- Create rename script (if needed)
- Verify post-rename compliance
- Document changes

**Achievement 0.3**: Compliance Documentation (1h)
- Document final compliance status
- Create naming guidelines
- Define validation process
- Integrate with methodology

## 📋 Key Findings

**Good News**: Preliminary analysis shows all files already follow correct naming patterns!

**What This Means**:
- Achievement 0.1 will formally verify compliance
- Achievement 0.2 may not require any renames
- Achievement 0.3 will document compliance and create guidelines

**Estimated Effort**: 2.5-4 hours (likely on lower end)
