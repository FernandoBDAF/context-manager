# ✅ RESOLUTION: PLAN/Filesystem Conflict

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Date**: 2025-11-09 08:25 UTC  
**Conflict Type**: Plan outdated vs filesystem state
**Resolution Time**: 2 minutes

---

## 🎯 Problem

The PLAN's "Current Status & Handoff" section was **outdated**:
- **Filesystem State**: ✅ Achievements 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 ALL COMPLETE
- **PLAN State**: ⏳ Listed only 0.1 & 0.2 complete, no mention of 0.3

**Root Cause**: PLAN not updated after Achievement 0.3 completion

---

## ✅ Resolution Applied

### Updated PLAN: `work-space/plans/EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE/PLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE.md`

**Changes Made**:

   ```

2. **"What's Done" Section Updated**
   - Added: ✅ **Achievement 0.3 COMPLETE** with full details
   - Details: LLM-METHODOLOGY.md update, execution work system section, naming conventions
   - Time: 1 hour (within 1-2h estimate)
   - Status: Complete, methodology updated

3. **"What's Next" Section Updated**
   - Reorganized to show Priority levels
   - Priority 0: ✅ ALL COMPLETE (0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
   - Priority 1: Achievement 1.1 (next to work on)
   - Priority 2: Achievements 2.1, 2.2
   - Clear progression shown
