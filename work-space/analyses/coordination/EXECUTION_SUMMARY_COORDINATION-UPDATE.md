## 📊 Coordination Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PLAN 1 | 🔄 Continue | Priorities 4-6 (20-30h remaining) |
| PLAN 2 | ✅ Transformed | Now validates PLAN 1 in new structure |
| PLAN 3 P0 | 🔄 Ready | Dual structure + migration prep |
| Coordination | ✅ Updated | Achievement 1.1 findings registered |

## 🎯 Impact

**Before**: PLAN 2 focused on "restoring broken automation" (misconceived goal)

**After**: PLAN 2 focuses on "validating refactored automation in new structure" (correct goal)

**Result**: Clearer separation of concerns, appropriate testing focus, better coordination
