## 🔍 Work Performed

### Phase 1: Status Inventory (Completed)
- **Identified** all 9 EXECUTION_TASK files in `work-space/execution/`
- **Extracted** current status fields: 2 showing "In Progress", 7 missing field entirely
- **Analyzed** iteration logs in each file to find completion markers
- **Cross-referenced** with audit findings (10/14 achievements claimed complete)

### Phase 2: Analysis & Decision (Completed)
- **Reviewed** content of all 9 files for completion markers
- **Found** that ALL files contain "Complete" markers in their content
- **Determined** that all 9 achievements were genuinely complete
- **Identified** status field lag as the root issue (outdated status headers)

### Phase 3: Automated Status Updates (Completed)
- **Created** Python script using regex to update status fields
- **Applied** script to all 9 EXECUTION_TASK files
- **Updated** status from "In Progress"/"Missing" to "✅ Complete"
- **Verified** all updates applied correctly

### Phase 4: Documentation & Report (Completed)
- **Created** comprehensive CONSISTENCY_REPORT documenting all changes
- **Listed** before/after status for each file
- **Noted** the missing status field issue and resolution
- **Verified** 100% consistency across all files
