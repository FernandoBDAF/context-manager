# SUBPLAN: Update LLM-METHODOLOGY.md with Execution Work Taxonomy

**Type**: SUBPLAN  
**Mother Plan**: PLAN_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE.md  
**Plan**: EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE  
**Achievement Addressed**: Achievement 0.3 (Update LLM-METHODOLOGY.md with Execution Work Taxonomy)  
**Achievement**: 0.3  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Created**: 2025-11-09 11:00 UTC  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

## 🎯 Objective

Integrate the execution work taxonomy (created in Achievements 0.1 and 0.2) into the core LLM-METHODOLOGY.md document, making execution work system officially part of the methodology documentation.

---

## 📋 What Needs to Be Created

### Files to Modify

- `LLM-METHODOLOGY.md` (core methodology document)

### Content Deliverables

1. **New Section**: "Execution Work System" (50-80 lines)

   - Overview of two execution work types
   - EXECUTION_TASK definition and characteristics
   - EXECUTION_WORK definition with types
   - Decision tree reference
   - Links to detailed guides and templates

2. **Updated Naming Convention Section**:

   - Add EXECUTION_WORK types to naming table
   - Include all 5 EXECUTION_WORK types

3. **Updated Document Size Table**:

   - Add rows for EXECUTION_WORK types
   - Show size ranges for each type
   - Show locations for each type

4. **Examples**:
   - Brief example of EXECUTION_TASK usage
   - Brief example of EXECUTION_WORK usage
   - Show both types in action

---

## 📝 Approach

**Strategy**: Integrate taxonomy into methodology without disrupting existing structure, placing new section after 5-tier hierarchy explanation.

**Method**:

1. **Analyze Current Structure**

   - Review LLM-METHODOLOGY.md layout
   - Identify optimal insertion point (after 5-tier hierarchy)
   - Ensure flow with existing content

2. **Create Execution Work System Section**

   - Overview paragraph (why two types matter)
   - EXECUTION_TASK in hierarchy context
   - EXECUTION_WORK outside hierarchy
   - Decision tree summary
   - Link to detailed guides

3. **Update Naming Convention Section**

   - Add EXECUTION_ANALYSIS naming pattern
   - Add EXECUTION_CASE-STUDY naming pattern
   - Add EXECUTION_OBSERVATION naming pattern
   - Add EXECUTION_DEBUG naming pattern
   - Add EXECUTION_REVIEW naming pattern

4. **Update Document Size Table**

   - Add EXECUTION_ANALYSIS row (200-1000 lines)
   - Add EXECUTION_CASE-STUDY row (200-1000 lines)
   - Add EXECUTION_OBSERVATION row (100-500 lines)
   - Add EXECUTION_DEBUG row (200-1000 lines)
   - Add EXECUTION_REVIEW row (200-1000 lines)
   - Show correct locations for each

5. **Add Examples**
   - EXECUTION_TASK example (brief)
   - EXECUTION_WORK example (brief)
   - Show context and naming

**Key Considerations**:

- Maintain LLM-METHODOLOGY.md's tone and structure
- Don't overshadow 5-tier hierarchy
- Link back to detailed guides for more info
- Keep examples concise and practical
- Ensure naming patterns consistent with taxonomy

---

## 🔄 Execution Strategy

**Execution Count**: Single

**Rationale**:

- Straightforward documentation integration
- Single clear approach (add section after hierarchy)
- No iteration needed
- All modifications fit in single execution

**EXECUTION_TASK**: `EXECUTION_TASK_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_03_01.md`

---

## 🧪 Tests Required

**Type**: Documentation review (no code tests)

### Validation Approach

1. **Structural Integrity**: Updated document still reads well
2. **Consistency Check**: Naming patterns match taxonomy
3. **Link Verification**: Links to guides/templates are correct
4. **Example Accuracy**: Examples reflect actual usage

### Success Criteria

- [ ] New section added and well-integrated
- [ ] Naming conventions updated for all types
- [ ] Document size table updated
- [ ] Examples clear and practical
- [ ] All links valid and point to correct resources
- [ ] Document structure maintained
- [ ] Updated file is readable and coherent

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### Observable Outcomes

- LLM-METHODOLOGY.md includes complete execution work system
- Naming conventions documented for all types
- Document size expectations clear for each type
- Examples show both EXECUTION_TASK and EXECUTION_WORK usage
- Links connect to detailed guides

### Success Indicators

- [ ] Execution work section complete and integrated
- [ ] All modifications technically correct
- [ ] Document remains under size limits
- [ ] References to Achievements 0.1 and 0.2 properly linked
- [ ] Ready for practitioners to use as reference

## 🔍 Conflict Analysis with Other Subplans

**Review Existing Subplans**:

- SUBPLAN_01: Taxonomy definition (✅ complete)
- SUBPLAN_02: Decision framework (✅ complete)

**Check for**:

- **Overlap**: No - documentation integration, not new concepts
- **Conflicts**: No - complementary to prior work
- **Dependencies**: Yes - requires SUBPLAN_01 and \_02 complete (✅ done)
- **Integration**: Perfect - integrates prior achievements into core docs

**Result**: Safe to proceed - integrates completed work into methodology

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

### Other Subplans

- SUBPLAN_01 (Taxonomy) - must be complete ✅
- SUBPLAN_02 (Decision Framework) - must be complete ✅

### External Dependencies

- Access to LLM-METHODOLOGY.md file
- Knowledge of existing document structure
- Links to EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md guide

### Prerequisite Knowledge

- Understanding from Achievements 0.1 and 0.2
- Familiarity with LLM-METHODOLOGY.md structure

---

## 🔄 Execution Task Reference

**Execution Tasks** (created during execution):

_None yet - will be created when execution starts_

**First Execution**: `EXECUTION_TASK_EXECUTION-TAXONOMY-AND-WORKSPACE_03_01.md`

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

**This Subplan is Complete When**:

- [ ] LLM-METHODOLOGY.md updated with execution work section
- [ ] Naming conventions updated for all types
- [ ] Document size table updated
- [ ] Examples added showing both types
- [ ] All links verified and correct
- [ ] Document structure and flow maintained
- [ ] EXECUTION_TASK complete
- [ ] Ready for archive

---

## 📝 Notes

**Common Pitfalls**:

- Making changes too extensive - keep focused on integration
- Breaking document structure - maintain existing flow
- Incomplete naming patterns - update all 5 EXECUTION_WORK types
- Missing links - ensure all references point to correct files

**Resources**:

- EXECUTION-TAXONOMY.md (Achievement 0.1 & 0.2)
- Existing LLM-METHODOLOGY.md structure
- Prior sections on naming and document sizing
