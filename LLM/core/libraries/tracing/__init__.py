"""
Tracing Library - Cross-Cutting Concern.

Provides distributed tracing, span management, and performance profiling.
Part of the CORE libraries - Tier 1 (full implementation).

TODO: Full implementation needed
- Span creation and nesting
- Trace context propagation
- Performance timing
- Integration with OpenTelemetry (optional)
- Trace export (JSON, Jaeger, etc.)

Usage (planned):
    from core.libraries.tracing import trace, current_trace, create_span

    @trace(operation='graph_extraction')
    def extract_entities(chunk):
        trace_id = current_trace().id

        with create_span('llm_call') as span:
            result = llm.extract(...)
            span.set_attribute('entities_found', len(result))

        return result

# TODO: Implement spans.py, context.py, decorators.py, exporters.py
