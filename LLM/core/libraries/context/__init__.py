"""
Context Management Library - Cross-Cutting Concern.

Provides request/operation context propagation across async boundaries.
Part of the CORE libraries - Tier 3 (stub only - future implementation).

Note: This is different from logging.context (which handles log context).
This library provides general-purpose context for requests, operations, etc.

TODO: Future implementation
- Request context (request_id, user_id, session_id, etc.)
- Context propagation across async calls
- Thread-local and async-local storage
- Context inheritance
- Context middleware for APIs

Usage (future):
    from core.libraries.context import set_context, get_context, with_context

    # Set context at request boundary
    set_context(request_id='req-123', user_id='user-456')

    # Access anywhere in call stack
    ctx = get_context()
    logger.info(f"Processing for user {ctx.user_id}")

    # Context decorator
    @with_context(operation='graph_extraction')
    def extract():
        # Context automatically available
        ...

__all__ = []  # FUTURE: Implement when needed
