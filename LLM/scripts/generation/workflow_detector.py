Workflow Detector Module - Filesystem-First State Detection"""
from __future__ import annotations  # Enable deferred type hint evaluation

"""

This module provides workflow state detection, conflict checking, and achievement
finding functionality for the prompt generation system.

**Filesystem-First State Tracking Philosophy**:
- PLAN's responsibility: Define Achievement Index (list of all achievements)
- Filesystem's responsibility: Track completion via APPROVED_XX.md files
- Conflicts detected between Achievement Index and filesystem only
- NO markdown parsing for state tracking (only for structure/handoff)

**Module Responsibilities**:
1. Detect workflow state (no_subplan, subplan_no_execution, active_execution, etc.)
2. Detect conflicts between Achievement Index and filesystem
3. Find next achievement using hybrid approach (handoff → status → archive → root)

**State Detection Strategy**:
- Check filesystem for SUBPLANs and EXECUTION_TASKs
- Check execution/feedbacks/ for APPROVED_XX.md files
- Use Achievement Index from PLAN as structure definition
- Ignore markdown patterns for state (filesystem is source of truth)

        """
        Detect workflow state using filesystem structure (not content parsing).

        This is the ROBUST detection method - checks actual files on disk rather
        than parsing markdown text. Introduced in Achievement 1.6 to eliminate
        parsing fragility and improve reliability.

        Detection Logic:
        1. Check if SUBPLAN file exists
        2. Check if SUBPLAN is marked complete (header check)
        3. Count EXECUTION_TASK files in filesystem
        4. Count completed EXECUTION_TASKs (status check)
        5. Compare completed vs total to determine state

        States Returned:
        - no_subplan: SUBPLAN doesn't exist → create_subplan
        - subplan_complete: SUBPLAN marked complete → next_achievement
        - subplan_no_execution: SUBPLAN exists, no EXECUTION files → create_execution
        - active_execution: Some EXECUTIONs incomplete → continue_execution or create_next_execution
        - subplan_all_executed: All EXECUTIONs complete → synthesize_or_complete

        Bug Fixes Incorporated:
            - Bug #6: Counts from filesystem, not SUBPLAN table (more reliable)
            - Bug #7: Finds highest execution number from filesystem
            - Handles multi-execution workflows correctly
            - Handles _V2 and other filename variations

        Args:
            plan_path: Path to PLAN file in nested structure
            feature_name: Feature name (e.g., "METHODOLOGY-HIERARCHY-EVOLUTION")
            achievement_num: Achievement number (e.g., "0.1")

        Returns:
            Dict with keys:

                - execution_count: int (total EXECUTION_TASKs planned/found)
                - completed_count: int (completed EXECUTION_TASKs)

        Find next achievement using multiple methods (hybrid approach).

        This is the MAIN achievement finding function - combines multiple detection

        Detection Methods (Priority Order):
        1. Parse PLAN handoff section (MOST AUTHORITATIVE)
           - Reads explicit "Next: Achievement X.Y" statement
           - Validates achievement exists and is not complete
           - Warns if handoff is stale

        2. Check PLAN status (FALLBACK for plans without clear "Next")
           - If status is "planning", return first achievement
           - Handles plans just starting

        3. Check archive directory (FALLBACK for archived SUBPLANs)
           - Finds first achievement without archived SUBPLAN
           - Skips completed achievements

        4. Check root directory (FALLBACK for flat structure)
           - Finds first achievement without SUBPLAN in root
           - Skips completed achievements

        Validation:
        - Checks if PLAN is complete FIRST (returns None if done)
        - Skips achievements marked complete
        - Warns if handoff mentions non-existent achievement
